# What's new?

There's absolutely nothing new about this update
apart from the fact that now you can run it on the ancient
operating system MS-DOS (it hasn't been tried out - but it should work)

## How's this relevant to me?
Unless you use MS-DOS - this isn't really that relevant to you
apart from the fact that you can now launch the program and see the console
right from cmd! (You could launch it from cmd before, but it would open a new window with the console)

Also, now the script is a little bit more concise.
