This update is an "unstable" update. It's basically a demo which visually shows you 
how the new protocols work.
###The Protocols:
First of all, as soon as you launch the program, it will search for a file called "sample.txt" 
in the same directory as the program. If it fails to find a file with that exact name - you shall see a an Unhandled Exception Error message. I'll let you be able to specify the file later

Having done that, it will now read the file and create two txt files in the same directory of the program called 
"CICHICHICHCIHIPAHIH" and "LOGGOGOGOO"
