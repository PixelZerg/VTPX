This update is an "unstable" update. It's basically a demo which visually shows you 
how the new protocols work.
###The Protocols:
First of all, as soon as you launch the program, it will search for a file called "sample.txt" 
in the same directory as the program. If it fails to find a file with that exact name - you shall see a an Unhandled
Exception Error message.
