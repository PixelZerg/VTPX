### Changelog:
- Added the choose file window

---

In this update, I introduce a new window. To access it - first, make sure that
the vocab file you wish to read is in the same directory as the program and click on the "choose vocab file..." button.
Then, type a keyword in the search bar (NB: it's case sensitive for now) - your file, along with it's path should
show up in the top section. Select it and close the settings window. Your vocab file should be now loaded and you should
be able to see the words in the console.

- in the search bar - if you wish to see all the .txt files in the directory - just search for a space then press backspace. I shall make all the files show up when the window is started in the future.
